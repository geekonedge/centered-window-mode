*NOTE*: Due to a lack of time to solve the issues of this project and the responsabilities derived from my recent paternity, I'm looking for someone to transfer the ownership of the project and who's willing to keep working in it.

* Centered Window Mode

  Global minor mode that centers the text of the window. If another
  window is visible the text goes back to normal if its width is less than =cwm-centered-window-width=.

  You may want to activate =visual-line-mode= if your lines go out of reach.

* Installation

** Manual installation

First, download =centered-window-mode.el= in your emacs load path.

Then, to make it available, add this to your configuration file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'centered-window-mode)
#+end_src

** Installation via el-get

If you use [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]], the emacs package manager, simply add =centered-window-mode= to your packages list.

** Installation via use-package

If you use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], simply add the following to your init file.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package centered-window :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

* Activation

** On-the-fly

Simply type =M-x centered-window-mode= in any buffer.

** Permanent

To make this permanent, add this to your emacs configuration file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'centered-window-mode)
(centered-window-mode t)
#+end_src

* Vertical padding

Adding vertical padding to an Emacs window is kind of hard, I have tried a lot of different solutions but most of them add a lot of complexity and source of bugs to the mode. Currently there are the options =cwm-use-vertical-padding= (default =nil=, set to =t= if you want this feature) and =cwm-frame-internal-border= (default =70=) to add some padding to the frame, it's far from ideal but I have found it at most acceptable for most of the use cases where I need this feature.

* Customization
  Once installed you can easily customize the mode use Emacs'
  customization mechanism: =M-x customize-group<RET>centered-window-mode=
